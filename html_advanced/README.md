# HTML SEMANTICS
HTML Semantics is the practice of using HTML elements that convey meaning and structure to the content of the webpage.<br>
Think of it, as a descriptive elements that allows developers to accurately represent the purpose and type of content they contain.<br>
In this project, I am going to use <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=Wk9JYJBBxrbIRSDK-0"> Figma </a> as reference to create a webpage using the HTML Semantics.<br>
You can create one with me!<br>
But first, create a <em>FIGMA</em> account<br> 
Then click <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=Wk9JYJBBxrbIRSDK-0"> here </a> and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.<br>
